# Vidtube
Vidtube is a project I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I designed a user interface that looks and feels like YouTube. I focused on building a clean and modern UX/UI design, paying attention to details like layout, responsiveness, and smooth user interactions. The project is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

In Vidtube, I recreated the core elements of YouTube’s front-end design, including the navigation bar, sidebar, video thumbnails, and video player layout. This project helped me strengthen my skills in frontend development, UI design, and responsive web design. It’s a great example of how I can create real-world inspired interfaces with a focus on user experience.
